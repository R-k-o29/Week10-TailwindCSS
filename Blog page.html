      The Real Leadership Lessons of Steve Jobs

        writ large: Steve Jobs cofounded Apple in his parents' garage in 1976,
        was ousted in 1985, returned to rescue it from near bankruptcy in 1997,
        and by the time he died, in October 2011, had built it into the world's
        most valuable company. Along the way he helped to transform seven
        industries: personal computing, animated movies, music, phones, tablet
        computing, retail stores, and digital publishing. He thus belongs in the
        pantheon of America's great innovators, along with Thomas Edison, Henry
        Ford, and Walt Disney. None of these men was a saint, but long after
        their personalities are forgotten, history will remember how they
        applied imagination to technology and business.

        One of the last times I saw him, after I had finished writing most of
        the book, I asked him again about his tendency to be rough on people.
        "Look at the results," he replied. "These are all smart people I work
        with, and any of them could get a top job at another place if they were
        truly feeling brutalized. But they don't." Then he paused for a few
        moments and said, almost wistfully, "And we got some amazing things
        done. Indeed, he and Apple had had a string of hits over the past dozen
        years that was greater than that of any other innovative company in
        modern times: iMac, iPod, iPod nano, iTunes Store, Apple Stores,
        MacBook, iPhone, iPad, App Store, OS X Lion-not to mention every Pixar
        film. And as he battled his final illness, Jobs was surrounded by an
        intensely loyal cadre of colleagues who had been inspired by him for
        years and a very loving wife, sister, and four children.
